# 🧑‍💻 Web-Based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software

## 📌 Problem
Traditional interview processes are often time-consuming and lack consistent, objective evaluation — especially in large-scale recruitment drives such as those conducted by DRDO.  

## 💡 Solution
We developed an **AI-driven interview platform** to automate and standardize recruitment. The platform simulates realistic interviews with dynamic question flows, evaluates candidate responses using **NLP models**, and provides objective scoring and feedback.  

## 👨‍💻 My Role
As a key member of a **6-person team**, I:
- Implemented **AI-based scoring** using **Hugging Face Transformers + NLTK**.  
- Integrated the NLP logic with a **Django REST backend**.  
- Developed a **dynamic React frontend** to ensure seamless user interaction.  

## 🚀 Impact
🏆 Our solution was awarded **Runner-up (National Finalist)** at **Smart India Hackathon 2024**.  
This demonstrated the platform’s potential to **streamline recruitment** and **improve evaluation quality & objectivity**.  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework  
- **Frontend**: React  
- **AI/NLP**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK  
- **Other Tools**: REST APIs, Postman  

## ✨ Key Features
- 🤖 **AI-Driven Interview Process** with dynamic question generation.  
- 📝 **Automated NLP-based Scoring** for objective candidate evaluation.  
- 🔄 **Full-Stack Implementation** (Django REST API + React frontend).  
- ⚖️ **Unbiased Candidate Assessment** with real-time feedback.  
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface** for candidates and recruiters.
